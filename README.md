# RateMySCU
For SCU students who would like to quickly compare professors and classes, **RateMySCU** is an application that allows students to painlessly summarize information about a particular class and professor quickly. Unlike CourseEval RateMySCU allows students to view information spread across multiple sources without downloading numerous PDFs.

## Infrastructure
This project consists of four distinct services as listed below:

| Service Name                                                      | Description                                                                                                                                        | Hosting Provider | Deploy Status                                                                                                                                                             |

| [Backend](https://backend.ratemyscu.bryan.cf) [(src)](./backend)  | A REST API used by the front-end service to retrieve course evaluation data.
